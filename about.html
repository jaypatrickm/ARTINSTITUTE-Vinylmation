        <p class="bodycopy">Disney Vinylmation is a brand of 3", 1.5" and 9" vinyl collectibles sold at Disney theme parks and other locations. The figures all have a common shape (that of Mickey Mouse) but have different themed markings, colors, and patterns. The first figures were introduced in November 2008.  </p>
        <p class="bodycopy3">Trading of figures is officially encouraged and practiced at Disney locations in a fashion similar to Disney pin trading. There are designated places where guests may trade figures with cast members.</p>
        <p class="bodycopy3">Vinylmation figures are sold in sealed packaging. The purchaser does not know which figure they are buying until they have openeed it. Each figure belongs to a series and all of the figures in a series are printed on the packaging for that series and the series comes in a large box. Each series has one unknown figure, termed the chaser.</p>
        <p class="bodycopy3">Some come with cards, stickers or another figure to make a set. In addition to being a mystery figure the chaser is also the rarest figure in each series. Limited edition nine-inch figures are also sold and these are visible without opening the package.</p>
